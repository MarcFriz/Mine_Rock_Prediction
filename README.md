- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn


## Usage

The dataset is devided into Rocks and Mines with 60 sensorvalues and one Label at the end.
#### Values
- Rock from 0.0 - 0.6
- Mine from 0.0 - 1.0


## Start
Train your model and then make some predictions.


## Environment 
I used Visual Studio with python to get my code running.
